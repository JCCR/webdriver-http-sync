# Contribution Guide

Please follow this guide when
creating issues or pull requests.

## Reporting a Bug

Before reporting a bug,
make sure you are using the latest versions of
the browsers that expose the bug.

Testing for this project is handled in
[testium](https://github.com/groupon/testium).
That means any changes made here need to be
tested in testium itself.

When reporting a bug,
please provide a minimal test case.
This can be a gist,
inline in the description,
or in the form of a pull request
that includes a failing test.

If you are contributing a bug fix,
make sure it has a passing test
in your pull request.

## Adding a Feature

Adding currently unimplemented WebDriver calls
will always be considered.
Eventually, sync-node-webdriver should support
all of the WebDriver calls in some way.
